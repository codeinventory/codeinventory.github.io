Nvidia GT 540M is bit old now it was released back in 2012 when I purchased my XPS-L502X this awesome Graphics card was armed with it, Its still very solid to use with it's 96 CUDA cores, specifications given here.. [GT 540M](http://www.geforce.com/hardware/notebook-gpus/geforce-gt-540m/specifications) 

It was very painfull for me to run a CUDA program on it as its having [Fermi Architechture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_%28microarchitecture%29) and Compute capability of 2.1. most of the online tutorials says that you need Kepler architecture  and more to run CUDA, but I have tried a lot to run them on my GT 540M, It was so painfull to adjust settings and run program on it that i almost screwed my laptop may times and spent plenty of nights fixing it back again, formatted and installed fresh installation 3 times as my trying & screwing  went beyond limit.

finally I got the desired settings to do for GT 540M and i can smoothly run program on my XPS :).

here are very few things you have to do (i mean i did, not necessarily will work for you), but yes if you have GT 540M it will work for you as well.

Few things to consider..

* It works if any only if your GPU is CUDA enabled.
* There are many versions of CUDA tool kit available, you have to find which works for your Graphics card.
* Nvidia released many versions of drivers as well, you have to find out which works for you.

Basic thing how CUDA works ... (Hardware <- OS <- Driver <- CUDA toolkit <- Your Program)  and all this fine tuning is must and in equlibrium.

To run CUDA program on your XPS L502X with Nvidia GT 540M i'm using 

* OS : Linux Mint Rosa -  3.19.0-32-generic #37~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Thu Oct 22 09:41:40 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
* CUDA toolkit - 5.5
* Nvidia Driver - 340.96

If everything is properly installed and you dont see any problem viewing your screen you most prbably can run cuda programs compiled with nvcc on same machine.
